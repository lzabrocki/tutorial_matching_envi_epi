Hello and welcome!

This website gathers all the materials for the paper *Matching Methods for Environmental Epidemiology: A Tutorial* by [Tarik Benmarhnia](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/tarik.benmarhnia), [Marie-Abèle Bind](https://biostatistics.massgeneral.org/faculty/marie-abele-bind-phd/), and [Léo Zabrocki](https://lzabrocki.github.io/).


using a real environmental data set, we conducted a simulation study of the effect of heat waves on daily number of years of life lost (YoLL) in Montreal over the 200
