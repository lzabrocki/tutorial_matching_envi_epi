# Tutorial's Structure

The air pollution and health effects of cruise vessel traffic is a growing concern in the Mediterranean area. We propose a novel methodology based on high-frequency observational data to estimate the causal effects of maritime traffic on pollution. We apply this method to cruise traffic in Marseille, a large Mediterranean port city. Using a new pair-matching algorithm designed for time series data, we create hypothetical randomized experiments and estimate the change in air pollution caused by a short-term increase in cruise traffic. We carry out a randomization-based approach to quantify uncertainty and compute 95\% Fisherian intervals (FI) consistent with the matched data.
