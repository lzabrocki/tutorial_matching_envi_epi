We propose a novel methodology based on high-frequency observational data to estimate the causal effects of maritime traffic on pollution. We apply this method to cruise traffic in Marseille, a large Mediterranean port city. Using a new pair-matching algorithm designed for time series data, we create hypothetical randomized experiments and estimate the change in air pollution caused by a short-term increase in cruise traffic. We carry out a randomization-based approach to quantify uncertainty and compute 95% Fisherian intervals (FI) consistent with the matched data.\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Matching Methods for Environmental Epidemiology: A Tutorial\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      \r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      \r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              a:link {\r\n                color: #0471a6;\r\n              }\r\n\r\n              a:hover {\r\n                color: #f4a261;\r\n              }\r\n\r\n              a:visited {\r\n                color: #0471a6;\r\n              }\r\n\r\n              h1 {\r\n                color: #0471a6;\r\n              }\r\n              \r\n              Tutorial’s Structure\r\n              The air pollution and health effects of cruise vessel traffic is a growing concern in the Mediterranean area.
